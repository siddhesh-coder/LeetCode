/*Given a characters array letters that is sorted in non-decreasing order and a character target, return the smallest character in the array that is larger than target.

        Note that the letters wrap around.

        For example, if target == 'z' and letters == ['a', 'b'], the answer is 'a'.


        Example 1:

        Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "a"
        Output: "c"
        Example 2:

        Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "c"
        Output: "f"
        Example 3:

        Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "d"
        Output: "f"


        Constraints:

        2 <= letters.length <= 104
        letters[i] is a lowercase English letter.
        letters is sorted in non-decreasing order.
        letters contains at least two different characters.
        target is a lowercase English letter.*/
